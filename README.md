## üöÄ Installation

1. **Install Dependencies**

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/openvpn-client-gui.git
   cd openvpn-client-gui
   ```

3. **Make Executable**

   chmod +x openvpn-status.py
   ```

4. **Create Desktop Entry** (optional)
   ```bash
   cp openvpn-status.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/
   sed -i "s|/home/USERNAME|$HOME|" ~/.local/share/applications/openvpn-status.desktop
   ```

## üìù Usage

### Configuration Files

Place your OpenVPN configuration files (.ovpn) in the `~/.config/openvpn/` directory.

### Running the Application

Launch the application by running:
```bash
./openvpn-status.py
```

Or click on the desktop icon if you created one.

### Connecting to VPN

1. Select a configuration file from the dropdown menu
2. Click "Connect"
3. Enter your password when prompted (for sudo access)
4. The application will display connection status and details

### Connection Status

The application uses color-coded borders to indicate connection status:
- **Red** - Disconnected
- **Yellow** - Connecting
- **Green** - Connected

### Viewing Logs

The application keeps a detailed log of all operations:

- View real-time logs in the application window
- Click "Clear Log" to clear the log display in the application
- Click "View Log" to open the complete log file in your default text editor

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Authentication Failed | Check your credentials in the OpenVPN configuration file |
| Connection Errors | Verify your internet connection and OpenVPN configuration |
| Permission Issues | Ensure pkexec is properly installed and configured |
| Stale Processes | The application will detect and offer to clean up any stale OpenVPN processes |

## üîí Security Considerations

- The application requires elevated privileges to establish VPN connections
- It uses pkexec to gain these privileges securely
- No passwords are stored by the application
- All credentials should be managed in your OpenVPN configuration files
